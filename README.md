# atom-fantasy-sports-advice
The goal of this project is to build out a suite of fantasy sports tools. For example right now we have a receptions calculator for the nfl which we use to predict how many receptions a given receiver will get in any given game. 

My goal for y'all is to first pick one of the four major sports (mlb, nhl, nfl, nba) and find either a free api or online resource you can utilize to gather data you'll need. 

From there we will build out some kind of model to predict a players stat line for a given game, based on variables you decide. 

Once data is organized, model is working, we will develop a front end (could be something as simple as a flask app) where users can go in and pick a player and can see stat line projections for a given game.

Dependning on time we can dive into multiple sports where i imagine the same kind of model can be reused or slightly changed to predict stats for different sports
